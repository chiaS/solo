    summary: 'In olden times when wishing still...',
    content: 'In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king\nwhose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful\nthat the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever\nit shone in her face.  Close by the king\'s castle lay a great dark\nforest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when\nthe day was very warm, the king\'s child went out into the forest and\nsat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she\ntook a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this\nball was her favorite plaything.\n\nNow it so happened that on one occasion the princess\'s golden ball\ndid not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it,\nbut on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.  The\nking\'s daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the\nwell was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.  At this\nshe began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be\ncomforted.  And as she thus lamented someone said to her, "What ails\nyou, king\'s daughter?  You weep so that even a stone would show pity."\n\nShe looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a\nfrog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water.  "Ah, old\nwater-splasher, is it you," she said, "I am weeping for my golden ball,\nwhich has fallen into the well."  "Be quiet, and do not weep," answered\nthe frog, "I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your\nplaything up again?"  "Whatever you will have, dear frog," said she, "My\nclothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am\nwearing."  The frog answered, "I do not care for your clothes, your\npearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me\nand let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your\nlittle table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of\nyour little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise\nme this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up\nagain."\n\n"Oh yes," said she, "I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring\nme my ball back again."  But she thought, "How the silly frog does\ntalk.  All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and\ncroak.  He can be no companion to any human being."\n\nBut the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the\nwater and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again\nwith the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.  The king\'s\ndaughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and\npicked it up, and ran away with it.  "Wait, wait," said the frog.  "Take\nme with you.  I can\'t run as you can."  But what did it avail him to\nscream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could.  She did\nnot listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was\nforced to go back into his well again.\n\nThe next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and\nall the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate,\nsomething came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble\nstaircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and\ncried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me."  She ran to\nsee who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog\nin front of it.  Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat\ndown to dinner again, and was quite frightened.  The king saw plainly\nthat her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what are\nyou so afraid of?  Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to\ncarry you away?"  "Ah, no," replied she.  "It is no giant but a disgusting\nfrog."\n\n"What does a frog want with you?"  "Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was\nin the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into\nthe water.  And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for\nme, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my\ncompanion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his\nwater.  And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me."\n\nIn the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,  "Princess,\nyoungest princess,  open the door for me,  do you not know what you\nsaid to me yesterday by the cool waters of the well.  Princess,\nyoungest princess,  open the door for me."\n\nThen said the king, "That which you have promised must you perform.\nGo and let him in."  She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped\nin and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and\ncried, "Lift me up beside you."  She delayed, until at last the king\ncommanded her to do it.  Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to\nbe on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push your\nlittle golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together."  She did\nthis, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.  The\nfrog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked\nher.  At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied, now I am\ntired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed\nready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."\n\nThe king\'s daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog\nwhich she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her\npretty, clean little bed.  But the king grew angry and said, "He who\nhelped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be\ndespised by you."  So she took hold of the frog with two fingers,\ncarried him upstairs, and put him in a corner, but when she was in\nbed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as\nyou, lift me up or I will tell your father."  At this she was terribly\nangry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the\nwall.  "Now, will you be quiet, odious frog," said she.  But when he\nfell down he was no frog but a king\'s son with kind and beautiful\neyes.  He by her father\'s will was now her dear companion and\nhusband.  Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked\nwitch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but\nherself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.\n\nThen they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a\ncarriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white\nostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden\nchains, and behind stood the young king\'s servant Faithful Henry.\nFaithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a\nfrog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart,\nlest it should burst with grief and sadness.  The carriage was to\nconduct the young king into his kingdom.  Faithful Henry helped them\nboth in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because\nof this deliverance.  And when they had driven a part of the way the\nking\'s son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken.\nSo he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."\n"No, master, it is not the carriage.  It is a band from my heart,\nwhich was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and\nimprisoned in the well."  Again and once again while they were on\ntheir way something cracked, and each time the king\'s son thought the\ncarriage was breaking, but it was only the bands which were springing\nfrom the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and\nwas happy.',
