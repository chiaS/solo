	"In olden times when wishing still...", 
	'In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a king
whose daughters were all beautiful, but the youngest was so beautiful
that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was astonished whenever
it shone in her face.  Close by the king\'s castle lay a great dark
forest, and under an old lime-tree in the forest was a well, and when
the day was very warm, the king\'s child went out into the forest and
sat down by the side of the cool fountain, and when she was bored she
took a golden ball, and threw it up on high and caught it, and this
ball was her favorite plaything.

Now it so happened that on one occasion the princess\'s golden ball
did not fall into the little hand which she was holding up for it,
but on to the ground beyond, and rolled straight into the water.  The
king\'s daughter followed it with her eyes, but it vanished, and the
well was deep, so deep that the bottom could not be seen.  At this
she began to cry, and cried louder and louder, and could not be
comforted.  And as she thus lamented someone said to her, "What ails
you, king\'s daughter?  You weep so that even a stone would show pity."

She looked round to the side from whence the voice came, and saw a
frog stretching forth its big, ugly head from the water.  "Ah, old
water-splasher, is it you," she said, "I am weeping for my golden ball,
which has fallen into the well."  "Be quiet, and do not weep," answered
the frog, "I can help you, but what will you give me if I bring your
plaything up again?"  "Whatever you will have, dear frog," said she, "My
clothes, my pearls and jewels, and even the golden crown which I am
wearing."  The frog answered, "I do not care for your clothes, your
pearls and jewels, nor for your golden crown, but if you will love me
and let me be your companion and play-fellow, and sit by you at your
little table, and eat off your little golden plate, and drink out of
your little cup, and sleep in your little bed - if you will promise
me this I will go down below, and bring you your golden ball up
again."

"Oh yes," said she, "I promise you all you wish, if you will but bring
me my ball back again."  But she thought, "How the silly frog does
talk.  All he does is to sit in the water with the other frogs, and
croak.  He can be no companion to any human being."

But the frog when he had received this promise, put his head into the
water and sank down; and in a short while came swimmming up again
with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.  The king\'s
daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more, and
picked it up, and ran away with it.  "Wait, wait," said the frog.  "Take
me with you.  I can\'t run as you can."  But what did it avail him to
scream his croak, croak, after her, as loudly as he could.  She did
not listen to it, but ran home and soon forgot the poor frog, who was
forced to go back into his well again.

The next day when she had seated herself at table with the king and
all the courtiers, and was eating from her little golden plate,
something came creeping splish splash, splish splash, up the marble
staircase, and when it had got to the top, it knocked at the door and
cried, "Princess, youngest princess, open the door for me."  She ran to
see who was outside, but when she opened the door, there sat the frog
in front of it.  Then she slammed the door to, in great haste, sat
down to dinner again, and was quite frightened.  The king saw plainly
that her heart was beating violently, and said, "My child, what are
you so afraid of?  Is there perchance a giant outside who wants to
carry you away?"  "Ah, no," replied she.  "It is no giant but a disgusting
frog."

"What does a frog want with you?"  "Ah, dear father, yesterday as I was
in the forest sitting by the well, playing, my golden ball fell into
the water.  And because I cried so, the frog brought it out again for
me, and because he so insisted, I promised him he should be my
companion, but I never thought he would be able to come out of his
water.  And now he is outside there, and wants to come in to me."

In the meantime it knocked a second time, and cried,  "Princess,
youngest princess,  open the door for me,  do you not know what you
said to me yesterday by the cool waters of the well.  Princess,
youngest princess,  open the door for me."

Then said the king, "That which you have promised must you perform.
Go and let him in."  She went and opened the door, and the frog hopped
in and followed her, step by step, to her chair. There he sat and
cried, "Lift me up beside you."  She delayed, until at last the king
commanded her to do it.  Once the frog was on the chair he wanted to
be on the table, and when he was on the table he said, "Now, push your
little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together."  She did
this, but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly.  The
frog enjoyed what he ate, but almost every mouthful she took choked
her.  At length he said, "I have eaten and am satisfied, now I am
tired, carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed
ready, and we will both lie down and go to sleep."

The king\'s daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold frog
which she did not like to touch, and which was now to sleep in her
pretty, clean little bed.  But the king grew angry and said, "He who
helped you when you were in trouble ought not afterwards to be
despised by you."  So she took hold of the frog with two fingers,
carried him upstairs, and put him in a corner, but when she was in
bed he crept to her and said, "I am tired, I want to sleep as well as
you, lift me up or I will tell your father."  At this she was terribly
angry, and took him up and threw him with all her might against the
wall.  "Now, will you be quiet, odious frog," said she.  But when he
fell down he was no frog but a king\'s son with kind and beautiful
eyes.  He by her father\'s will was now her dear companion and
husband.  Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked
witch, and how no one could have delivered him from the well but
herself, and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom.

Then they went to sleep, and next morning when the sun awoke them, a
carriage came driving up with eight white horses, which had white
ostrich feathers on their heads, and were harnessed with golden
chains, and behind stood the young king\'s servant Faithful Henry.
Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a
frog, that he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart,
lest it should burst with grief and sadness.  The carriage was to
conduct the young king into his kingdom.  Faithful Henry helped them
both in, and placed himself behind again, and was full of joy because
of this deliverance.  And when they had driven a part of the way the
king\'s son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken.
So he turned round and cried, "Henry, the carriage is breaking."
"No, master, it is not the carriage.  It is a band from my heart,
which was put there in my great pain when you were a frog and
imprisoned in the well."  Again and once again while they were on
their way something cracked, and each time the king\'s son thought the
carriage was breaking, but it was only the bands which were springing
from the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and
was happy.', 'http://www.litstack.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/frog-king.jpg');

VALUES ('Little Red Cap', 'Brothers Grimm', 'Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved
by every one', 'Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved
by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her
grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have
given to the child.  Once she gave her a little cap of red
velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear
anything else.  So she was always called little red-cap.

One day her mother said to her, come, little red-cap, here
is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.  Take them to your
grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good.
Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk
nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may
fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will
get nothing.  And when you go into her room, don\'t forget
to say, good-morning, and don\'t peep into every corner before
you do it.

I will take great care, said little red-cap to her mother, and
gave her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the
village, and just as little red-cap entered the wood, a wolf
met her.  Red-cap did not know what a wicked creature he was,
and was not at all afraid of him.

"Good-day, little red-cap," said he.

"Thank you kindly, wolf."

"Whither away so early, little red-cap?"

"To my grandmother\'s."

"What have you got in your apron?"

"Cake and wine.  Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick
grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger."

"Where does your grandmother live, little red-cap?"

"A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood.  Her house
stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just
below.  You surely must know it," replied little red-cap.

The wolf thought to himself, what a tender young creature.  What a
nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old
woman.  I must act craftily, so as to catch both.  So he walked
for a short time by the side of little red-cap, and then he
said, "see little red-cap, how pretty the flowers are about here.
Why do you not look round.  I believe, too, that you do not
hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.  You walk gravely
along as if you were going to school, while everything else out
here in the wood is merry."

Little red-cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams
dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers
growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a
fresh nosegay.  That would please her too.  It is so early in the
day that I shall still get there in good time.  And so she ran
from the path into the wood to look for flowers.  And whenever
she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one
farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into
the wood.

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother\'s house and
knocked at the door.

\'Who is there?\'

\'Little red-cap,\' replied the wolf.  \'She is bringing cake and
wine.  Open the door.\'

\'Lift the latch,\' called out the grandmother, \'I am too weak, and
cannot get up.\'

The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without
saying a word he went straight to the grandmother\'s bed, and
devoured her.  Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in
her cap, laid himself in bed and drew the curtains.

Little red-cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,
and when she had gathered so many that she could carry
no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the
way to her.

She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and
when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that
she said to herself, oh dear, how uneasy I feel to-day, and at
other times I like being with grandmother so much.  She called
out, \'good morning,\' but received no answer.  So she went to the
bed and drew back the curtains.  There lay her grandmother with
her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.

\'Oh, grandmother,\' she said, \'what big ears you have.\'

\'The better to hear you with, my child,\' was the reply.

\'But, grandmother, what big eyes you have,\' she said.

\'The better to see you with,\' my dear.

\'But, grandmother, what large hands you have.\'

\'The better to hug you with.\'

\'Oh, but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have.\'

\'The better to eat you with.\'

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was
out of bed and swallowed up red-cap.

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in
the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.  The
huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, how
the old woman is snoring.  I must just see if she wants anything.

So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw
that the wolf was lying in it.  Do I find you here, you old
sinner, said he.  I have long sought you.  Then just as he was going
to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have
devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so
he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut
open the stomach of the sleeping wolf.  When he had made two
snips, he saw the little red-cap shining, and then he made two
snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, ah, how
frightened I have been.  How dark it was inside the wolf.  And
after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely
able to breathe.  Red-cap, however, quickly
fetched great stones with which they filled the wolf\'s belly, and
when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so
heavy that he collapsed at once, and fell dead.

Then all three were delighted.  The huntsman drew off the wolf\'s
skin and went home with it.  The grandmother ate the cake and
drank the wine which red-cap had brought, and revived, but
red-cap thought to herself, as long as I live, I will never by
myself leave the path, to run into the wood, when my mother has
forbidden me to do so.

It is also related that once when red-cap was again taking cakes
to the old grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to
entice her from the path.  Red-cap, however, was on her guard,
and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother
that she had met the wolf, and that he had said good-morning to
her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes, that if they had
not been on the public road she was certain he would have eaten
her up.  Well, said the grandmother, we will shut the door, that
he may not come in.  Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried,
open the door, grandmother, I am little red-cap, and am bringing
you some cakes.  But they did not speak, or open the door, so
the grey-beard stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last
jumped on the roof, intending to wait until red-cap went home in
the evening, and then to steal after her and devour her in the
darkness.  But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.  In
front of the house was a great stone trough, so she said to the
child, take the pail, red-cap.  I made some sausages yesterday,
so carry the water in which I boiled them to the trough.  Red-cap
carried until the great trough was quite full.   Then the smell
of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped
down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could
no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down
from the roof straight into the great trough, and was drowned.
But red-cap went joyously home, and no one ever did anything
to harm her again.',

	'There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in
	wait.  He had a fresh and joyous heart', 
	'There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in
wait.  He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither,
whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him
and said, "Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and
contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an
alms." The huntsman took pity on the poor old creature, felt in his
pocket, and gave her what he could afford.

He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and
said, "Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you.  I will make you a
present in return for your good heart.  Go on your way now, but in a
little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting
which have a cloak in their claws, and are fighting for it, take your
gun and shoot into the midst of them.  They will let the cloak fall
down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down
dead.  Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak.  When you throw
it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain
place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye.  Take out
the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning
early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your
pillow." The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself,
"Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come
true." And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard
in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he
looked up and saw there a swarm of birds who were tearing a piece of
cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as
if each wanted to have it all to himself.  "Well," said the huntsman,
"this is amazing, it has really come to pass just as the old crone
foretold," and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired
right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about.  The
birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped
down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time.  Then the huntsman
did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the
heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him.

Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he
wished to see if it also had been fulfilled.  When he lifted up the
pillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found
another, and so it went on, every time he got up.  He gathered
together a heap of gold, but at last he thought, "Of what use is all
my gold to me if I stay at home?  I will go forth and see the world."

He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman\'s pouch
and gun, and went out into the world.  It came to pass, that one day
he traveled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of
it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle.  An old woman was
standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of
the windows.  The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the
maiden, "There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful
treasure in his body.  We must filch it from him, daughter of my
heart, it is more suitable for us than for him.  He has a bird\'s
heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning
under his pillow." She told her what she was to do to get it, and
what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with
angry eyes, "And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the
worse for you." Now when the huntsman came nearer he noticed the
maiden, and said to himself, "I have traveled about for such a long
time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle.
I have certainly money enough." Nevertheless, the real reason was
that he had caught sight of the beautiful picture.

He entered the house, and was well received and courteously
entertained.  Before long he was so much in love with the young witch
that he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as
she saw them, and liked to do what she desired.  The old woman then
said, "Now we must have the bird\'s heart, he will never miss it." She
brewed a potion, and when it was ready, poured it into a goblet and
gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman.  She
did so, saying, "Now, my dearest, drink to me."

So he took the goblet, and when he had swallowed the draught, he
brought up the heart of the bird.  The girl had to take it away
secretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so.
Thenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay
instead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched
it away every morning, but he was so much in love and so befooled,
that he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the
girl.

Then the old witch said, "We have the bird\'s heart, but we must also
take the wishing-cloak away from him." The girl answered, "We will
leave him that, he has lost his wealth." The old woman was angry and
said, "Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found
in this world.  I must and will have it." She gave the girl several
blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with
her.  So she did the old woman\'s bidding, placed herself at the
window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very
sorrowful.  The huntsman asked, "Why do you stand there so
sorrowfully?" "Ah, my beloved," was her answer, "over yonder lies the
garnet mountain, where the precious stones grow.  I long for them so
much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get
them.  Only the birds, they fly and can reach them, but a man never."
"Have you nothing else to complain of?" said the huntsman.  "I will
soon remove that burden from your heart." With that he drew her under
his mantle, wished himself on the garnet mountain, and in the
twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together.  Precious
stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see
them, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them.

Now, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the
eyes of the huntsman should become heavy.  He said to the maiden, "We
will sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer
stand on my feet." Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her
lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle
from his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets
and stones, and wished herself back at home with them.

But when the huntsman had slept his fill and awoke, and perceived
that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild
mountain, he said, "Oh, what treachery there is in the world," and
sat down there in trouble and sorrow, not knowing what to do.  But
the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt
thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before
he saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were
sunk in a deep sleep.

Then the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and
said, "What sort of an earth-worm is this, lying here contemplating
his inside?" The second said, "Step upon him and kill him." But the
third said, contemptuously, "That would indeed be worth your while,
just let him live, he cannot remain here, and when he climbs higher,
toward the summit of of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him
and bear him away." So saying they passed by.  But the huntsman had
paid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and
climbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a
while, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away,
and traveled about for a long time in the heavens.  Then it sank
lower, and let itself down on a great cabbage-garden, girt round by
walls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and
vegetables.

Then the huntsman looked about him and said, "If I had but something
to eat.  I am so hungry, and to proceed on my way from here will be
difficult.  I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort
of fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages, but at length he thought,
at a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste
particularly good, but they will refresh me." With that he picked
himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he
swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite
different.

Four legs grew on him, a thick head and two long ears, and he saw
with horror that he was changed into an ass.  Still as his hunger
increased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his
present nature, he went on eating with great zest.  At last he
arrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had
swallowed it, he again felt a change, and resumed his former human
shape.

Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue.  When he awoke
next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another
of the good ones, and thought to himself, this shall help me to get
my own again and punish treachery.  Then he took the cabbages with
him, climbed over the wall, and went forth to look for the castle of
his sweetheart.  After wandering about for a couple of days he was
lucky enough to find it again.  He dyed his face brown, so that his
own mother would not have known him, and begged for shelter, "I am so
tired," said he, "that I can go no further." The witch asked, "Who
are you, countryman, and what is your business?" "I am a king\'s
messenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which
grows beneath the sun.  I have even been so fortunate as to find it,
and am carrying it about with me, but the heat of the sun is so
intense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not
know if I can carry it any further."

When the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and
said, "Dear countryman, let me just try this wonderful salad." "Why
not?" answered he.  "I have brought two heads with me, and will give
you one of them," and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad
cabbage.  The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so
for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed
it.  When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the
table, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her
mouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her
human shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an
ass.

Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad
standing there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up, but on
the way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste,
and she ate a couple of leaves.  Instantly the magic power showed
itself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman,
and the dish of salad fell to the ground.

Meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one
came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, "I
don\'t know what has become of the salad." The huntsman thought, the
salad must have already taken effect, and said, "I will go to the
kitchen and inquire about it." As he went down he saw the two asses
running about in the courtyard, the salad, however, was lying on the
ground. "All right," said he, "the two have taken their portion," and
he picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried
them to the maiden.  "I bring you the delicate food myself," said he,
"in order that you may not have to wait longer." Then she ate of it,
and was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and
ran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass.

After the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones
could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said, "Now
you shall receive the wages of your treachery," and bound them
together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came
to a mill.  He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head,
and asked what he wanted.  "I have three unmanageable beasts,
answered he, which I don\'t want to keep any longer.  Will you take
them in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I
tell you, and then I will pay you what you ask?" The miller said,
"Why not?  But how am I to manage them?" The huntsman then said that
he was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey,
and that was the witch, one beating and three meals to the younger
one, which was the servant-girl, and to the youngest, which was the
maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself
to have the maiden beaten. After that he went back into the castle,
and found therein everything he needed.

After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him
that the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal
daily was dead.  The two others, he continued, are certainly not
dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they
cannot last much longer.  The huntsman was moved to pity, put away
his anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him.  And
when they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they
became human again.  The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him,
and said, "Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you,
my mother drove me to it.  It was done against my will, for I love
you dearly.  Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the
bird\'s-heart I will take a vomiting potion." But he thought
otherwise, and said, "Keep it.  It is all the same, for I will take
you for my true wife." So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived
happily together until their death.',

felt for her, that at length the mouse agreed that they should
live and keep house together.  But we must make a provision
for winter, or else we shall suffer from hunger, said the cat,
and you, little mouse, cannot venture everywhere, or you will be
caught in a trap some day.  The good advice was followed, and a
pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where to put it.
At length, after much consideration, the cat said, I know no place
where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one
dares take anything away from there.  We will set it beneath the
altar, and not touch it until we are really in need of it.  So
the pot was placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat
had a great yearning for it, and said to the mouse, I want to
tell you something, little mouse, my cousin has brought a little
son into the world, and has asked me to be godmother, he is white
with brown spots, and I am to hold him over the font at the
christening.  Let me go out to-day, and you look after the house
by yourself.  Yes, yes, answered the mouse, by all means go, and if
you get anything very good to eat, think of
me, I should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.
All this, however, was untrue, the cat had no cousin, and had not
been asked to be godmother.  She went straight to the church, stole
to the pot of fat, began to lick at it, and licked the top of the
fat off.  Then she took a walk upon the roofs of the town, looked
out for opportunities, and then stretched herself in the sun, and
licked her lips whenever she thought of the pot of fat, and not
until it was evening did she return home.  Well, here you are
again, said the mouse, no doubt you have had a merry day.  All went
off well, answered the cat.  What name did they give the child.
Top off, said the cat quite coolly.  Top off, cried the mouse,
that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in your
family.  What does that matter, said the cat, it is no worse than
crumb-stealer, as your God-children are called.
Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning.  She
said to the mouse, you must do me a favor, and once more manage
the house for a day alone.  I am again asked to be godmother, and,
as the child has a white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.
The good mouse consented, but the cat crept behind the town walls
to the church, and devoured half the pot of fat.  Nothing ever
seems so good as what one keeps to oneself, said she, and was quite
satisfied with her day\'s work.  When she went home the mouse
inquired, and what was this child christened.  Half-done, answered
the cat.  Half-done.  What are you saying.  I never heard the name
in my life, I\'ll wager anything it is not in the calendar.
The cat\'s mouth soon began to water for some more licking.  All
good things go in threes, said she, I am asked to stand godmother
again.  The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with
that exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body,
this only happens once every few years, you will let me go, won\'t
you.  Top-off.  Half-done, answered the mouse, they are such odd
names, they make me very thoughtful.  You sit at home, said the
cat, in your dark-grey fur coat and long tail, and are filled
with fancies, that\'s because you do not go out in the daytime.
During the cat\'s absence the mouse cleaned the house, and put it
in order
but the greedy cat entirely emptied the pot of fat.  When
everything is eaten up one has some peace, said she to herself,
and well filled and fat she did not return home till night.  The
mouse at once asked what name had been given to the third child.
It will not please you more than the others, said the cat.  He
is called all-gone.  All-gone, cried the mouse, that is the most
suspicious name of all.  I have never seen it in print.  All-gone,
what can that mean, and she shook her head, curled herself up,
and lay down to sleep.
From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be
found outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said,
come cat, we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up
for ourselves - we shall enjoy that.  Yes, answered the cat, you
will enjoy it as much as you would enjoy sticking that dainty
tongue of yours out of the window.  They set out on their way,
but when they arrived, the pot of fat certainly was still in its
place, but it was empty.  Alas, said the mouse, now I see what has
happened, now it comes to light.  You are a true friend.  You
have devoured all when you were standing godmother.  First top off
then half done, then -.  Will you hold your tongue, cried the
cat, one word more and I will eat you too.  All gone was already
on the poor mouse\'s lips, scarcely had she spoken it before the
cat sprang on her, seized her, and swallowed her down.  Verily,
that is the way of the world.',
